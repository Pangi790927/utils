 * Introduction
 * ===============
 * 
 * In C++20 a new feature was added, namely coroutines. This feature allows the creation of a kind
 * of special function named a coroutine that can have its execution suspended and resumed later on.
 * Classical functions also do this to a degree, but they only suspend for the duration of the call 
 * of functions that run inside them. Classical functions form a stack of data with their frames,
 * where coroutines have heap-allocated frames without a clear stack-like order. A classical
 * function is suspended when it calls another function and resumed when the called function
 * returns. Its frame, or state if you will, is created when the function is called and destroyed
 * when the function returns. A coroutine has more suspension points, normal functions can be called
 * but there are two more suspension points added: co_await and co_yield, in both, the state is left
 * in the coroutine frame and the execution is continued outside the coroutine. In the case of this
 * library co_await suspends the current coroutine until the 'called' awaiter is complete and the
 * co_yield suspends the current coroutine, letting the 'calling' coroutine to continue. The main
 * point of coroutines is that while a coroutine waits to be resumed another one can be executed,
 * obtaining an asynchronous execution similar to threads but on a single thread (Those can also be
 * usually run on multiple threads, but that is not supported by this library), this almost
 * eliminates the need to use synchronization mechanisms.
 * 
 * Let's consider an example of a coroutine calling another coroutine:
 * 
 * ```cpp
 * 14: colib::task<int32_t> get_messages() {
 * 15:     int value;
 * 16: 
 * 17:     while (true) {
 * 18:         value = co_await get_message();
 * 19:         if (value == 0)
 * 20:             break;
 * 21:         co_yield value;
 * 22:     }
 * 22:     co_return 0;
 * 23: }
 * ```
 * 
 * At line 11, the coroutine is declared. As you can see, coroutines need to declare their return
 * value of the type of their handler object, namely colib::task<Type>. That is because the
 * coroutine holds the return value inside the state of the coroutine, and the user only gets the
 * handler to the coroutine.
 * 
 * At line 15, another awaiter, in this case another coroutine, is awaited with the use of co_await.
 * This will suspend the get_messages coroutine at that point, letting other coroutines on the
 * system run if there are any that need to do work, or block until a coroutine gets work to do.
 * Finally, this coroutine continues to line 16 when a message becomes available. Note that this
 * continuation will happen if a) there are no things to do or b) if another coroutine awaits
 * something and this one is the next that waits for execution.
 * 
 * Assuming value is not 0, the coroutine yields at line 18, returning the value but keeping its
 * state. This state contains the variable value and some other internals of coroutines.
 * 
 * When the message 0 is received, the coroutine returns 0, freeing its internal state. You
 * shouldn't call the coroutine anymore after this point.
 * 
 * ```cpp
 * 24: colib::task<int32_t> co_main() {
 * 25:     colib::task<int32_t> messages = get_messages();
 * 26:     while (int32_t value = co_await messages) {
 * 27:         printf("message: %d\n", value);
 * 28:     }
 * 29:     co_return 0;
 * 30: }
 * ```
 * 
 * The coroutine that calls the above coroutine is co_main. You can observe the creation of the
 * coroutine at line 25; what looks like a call of the coroutine in fact allocates the coroutine
 * state and returns the handle that can be further awaited, as you can see in the for loop at
 * line 26.
 * 
 * The coroutine will be called until value is 0, in which case we know that the coroutine has ended
 * (from its code) and we break from the for loop.
 * 
 * We observe that at line 31 we co_return 0; that is because the co_return is mandatory at the end
 * of coroutines (as mandated by the language).
 * 
 * ```cpp
 *  0: int cnt = 3;
 *  1: colib::task<int32_t> get_message() {
 *  2:     co_await colib::sleep_s(1);
 *  3:     co_return cnt--;
 *  4: }
 *  5: 
 *  6: colib::task<int32_t> co_timer() {
 *  7:     int x = 50;
 *  8:     while (x > 0) {
 *  9:         printf("timer: %d\n", x--);
 * 10:         co_await colib::sleep_ms(100);
 * 11:     }
 * 12:     co_return 0;
 * 13: }
 * ```
 * 
 * Now we can look at an example for get_message at line 1. Of course, in a real case, we would 
 * await a message from a socket, for some device, etc., but here we simply wait for a timer of 1
 * second to finish.
 * 
 * As for an example of something that can happen between awaits, we can look at co_timer at line 6.
 * This is another coroutine that prints x and waits 100 ms, 50 times. If you copy and run the
 * message yourself, you will see that the prints from the co_timer are more frequent and in-between
 * the ones from co_main.
 * 
 * ```cpp
 * 31: int main() {
 * 32:     colib::pool_p pool = colib::create_pool();
 * 33:     pool->sched(co_main());
 * 34:     pool->sched(co_timer());
 * 35:     pool->run();
 * 36: }
 * ```
 * 
 * Finally, we can look at main. As you can see, we create the pool at line 34, schedule the main
 * coroutine and the timer one, and we wait on the pool. The run function won't exit unless there
 * are no more coroutines to run or, as we will see later on, if a force_awake is called, or if an
 * error occurs.
 * 
 * Library Layout
 * ==============
 * 
 * The library is split in four main sections:
 * 1. The documentation
 * 2. Macros and structs/types
 * 3. Function definitions
 * 4. Implementation
 * 
 * Task
 * ====
 * 
 * As explained, each coroutine has an internal state. This state remembers the return value of the
 * function, its local variables, and some other coroutine-specific information. All of these are
 * remembered inside the coroutine promise. Each coroutine has, inside its promise, a state_t state
 * that remembers important information for its scheduling within this library. You can obtain this
 * state by (await get_state()) inside the respective coroutine for which you want to obtain the
 * state pointer. This state will live for as long as the coroutine lives, but you would usually
 * ignore its existence. The single instance for which you would use the state is if you are using
 * modifications (see below).
 * 
 * To each such promise (state, return value, local variables, etc.), the language assigns a handle
 * in the form of std::coroutine_handle<PromiseType>. These handles are further managed by tasks
 * inside this library. So, for a coroutine, you will get a task as a handle. The task further
 * specifies the type of the promise and implicitly the return value of the coroutine, but you don't
 * need to bother with those details.
 * 
 * A task is also an awaitable. As such, when you await it, it calls or resumes the awaited
 * coroutine, depending on the state it was left in. The await operation will resume the caller
 * either on a co_yield (the C++ yield; colib::yield does something else) or on a co_return of the
 * callee. In the latter case, the awaited coroutine is also destroyed, and further awaits on its
 * task are undefined behavior.
 * 
 * The task type, as in colib::task<Type>, is the type of the return value of the coroutine.
 * 
 * Pool
 * ====
 * 
 * For a task, the pool is its running space. A task runs on a pool along with other tasks. This
 * pool can be run only on one thread, i.e., there are no thread synchronization primitives used,
 * except in the case of COLIB_ENABLE_MULTITHREAD_SCHED.
 * 
 * The pool remembers the coroutines that are ready and resumes them when the currently running
 * coroutine yields to wait for some event (as in colib::yield). The pool also holds the allocator
 * used internally and the io_pool and timers, which are explained below and are responsible for
 * managing the asynchronous waits in the library.
 * 
 * A task remembers the pool it was scheduled on while either (co_await colib::sched(task)) or
 * pool_t::sched(task) are used on the respective task.
 * 
 * There are many instances where there are two variants of a function: one where the function has
 * the pool as an argument and another where that argument is omitted, but the function is in fact a
 * coroutine that needs to be awaited. Inside a coroutine, using await on a function, the pool is
 * deduced automatically from the running coroutine.
 * 
 * From inside a running coroutine, you can use (co_await colib::get_pool()) to get the pool of the
 * running coroutine.
 * 
 * Semaphores
 * ==========
 * 
 * Semaphores are created by using the function/coroutine create_sem and are handled by using
 * sem_p smart pointers. They have a counter that can be increased by signaling them or decreased by
 * one if the counter is bigger than 0 by using wait. In case the counter is 0 or less than 0, the
 * wait function blocks until the semaphore is signaled. In this library, semaphores are a bit
 * unusual, as they can be initialized to a value that is less than 0 so that multiple awaiters can
 * wait for a task to finish.
 * 
 * IO Pool
 * ==========
 * 
 * Inside the pool, there is an Input/Output event pool that implements the operating
 * system-specific asynchronous mechanism within this library. It offers a way to notify a single
 * function for multiple requested events to either be ready or completed in conjunction with a
 * state_t \*. In other words, we add pairs of the form (io_desc_t, state_t \*) and wait on a function
 * for any of the operations described by io_desc_t to be completed. We do this in a single place to
 * wait for all events at once.
 * 
 * On Linux, the epoll_\* functions are used, and on Windows, the IO Completion Port mechanism is
 * used.
 * 
 * Of course, all these operations are done internally.
 * 
 * Allocator
 * =========
 * 
 * Another internal component of the pool is the allocator. Because many of the internals of
 * coroutines have the same small memory footprint and are allocated and deallocated many times, an
 * allocator was implemented that keeps the allocated objects together and also ignores some costs
 * associated with new or malloc. This allocator can be configured (COLIB_ALLOCATOR_SCALE) to hold
 * more or less memory, as needed, or ignored completely (COLIB_DISABLE_ALLOCATOR), with malloc
 * being used as an alternative. If the memory given to the allocator is used up, malloc is used for
 * further allocations.
 * 
 * Timers
 * ======
 * 
 * Another internal component of the pool is the timer_pool_t. This component is responsible
 * for implementing and managing OS-dependent timers that can run with the IO pool. There are a
 * limited number of these timers allocated, which limits the maximum number of concurrent sleeps.
 * This number can be increased by changing COLIB_MAX_TIMER_POOL_SIZE.
 * 
 * Modifs
 * ======
 * 
 * Modifications are callbacks attached to coroutines that are called in specific cases:
 * on suspend/resume, on call/sched (after a valid state_t is created), on IO wait (on both wait and
 * finish wait), and on semaphore wait and unwait.
 * 
 * These callbacks can be used to monitor the coroutines, to acquire resources before re-entering a
 * coroutine, etc. (Internally, these are used for some functions; be aware while replacing existing
 * ones not to break the library's modifications).
 * 
 * Modifications can be inherited by coroutines in two cases: on call and on sched. More precisely,
 * each modification can be inherited by a coroutine scheduled from this one or called from this
 * one. You can modify the modifications for each coroutine using its task to get/add/remove
 * modifications or awaiters from inside the current coroutine.
 * 
 * Debugging
 * =========
 * 
 * Sometimes unwanted behavior can occur. If that happens, it may be debugged using the internal
 * helpers, those are:
 *   - dbg_enum            - get the description of a library enum code
 *   - dbg_name            - when COLIB_ENABLE_DEBUG_NAMES is true, it can be used to get the name
 *                           associated with a task, a coroutine handle or a coroutine promise
 *                           address, those can be registered with COLIB_REGNAME or
 *                           dbg_register_name
 *   - dbg_create_tracer   - creates a modif_pack_t that can be attached to a coroutine to debug all
 *                           the coroutine that it calls or schedules
 *   - log_str             - the function that is used to print a logging string (user can change
 *                           it)
 *   - dbg                 - the function used to log a formatted string
 *   - dbg_format          - the function used to format a string
 * 
 * All those are enabled by COLIB_ENABLE_LOGGING true, else those are disabled.
 *

/*! @brief Custom allocator for this library. Holds a small portion of memory for fast use/reuse
 *         by the library.
 * 
 * There are two things that don't need custom allocating: lowspeed stuff and the corutine promise.
 * It makes no sense to allocate the corutine promise because:
 * 
 * 1. It is a user defined type so the promise is not going to fit well in our allocator
 * 2. I expect it be allocated rarelly
 * 3. It would be a pain to allocate them
 * 4. a malloc now and then is not such a big deal
 * 
 * For the rest of the code those 4 are not generaly true.
 * 
 * The idea of this allocator is that allocated objects are actually small in size and get allocated/
 * deallocated fast. The assumption is that there is a direct corellation with the number
 * num_fds+call_depth, and most of the time there aren't that many file descriptors or depth to
 * calls (at least from my experience).
 * 
 * So what it does is this: it has 5 bucket levels: 32, 64, 128, 512, 2048 (bytes), with a number of
 * maximum allocations 16384, 8192, 4096, 1024 and 256 of each and a stack coresponding to each of
 * them, that is initiated at the start to contain every index from 0 to the max amount of slots in
 * each bucket. When an allocation occours, an index is poped from the lowest fitting bucket, and
 * that slot is returned. On a free, if the memory is from a bucket, the index is calculated and pushed
 * back in that bucket's stack else the normal free is used.
 * 
 * Those bucket levels can be configured, by changing the array bellow (Obs: The buckets must be in
 * ascending size order).
 * 
 * The improvement from malloc, as a guess, (I used a profiler to see if it does something) is that

 * 1. the memory is already there, no need to fetch it if not available and no need to check if it
 * is available
 * 2. there are no locks. since we already assume that the code that does the allocations is
 * protected either by the absence of multithreading or by the pool's lock
 * 3. there is no fragmentation, at least until the memory runs out, the pool's memory is localized
